Angular 7 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide Course from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in Udemy - Notes

## Section 1

### Getting Started

- Added Bootstrap using NPM and imported to style.css by pointing it to nodemodules bootstrap.min.css.

## Section 2

### The Basics

- Learned about the Modules, Components and Decorators.
- Learned about Components features - `template` and `styles` instead of "templateUrl and styleUrls"
- Learned about creating a component using `ng generate component <component name>`.
- String Interpolation = {{ }} to pass the value from typerscript to html.
- Property Binding - `(event) = "typescript variables or function to perform"`
- Learned directives `*ngIf="value; else anyvariable`, `ngStyle` and `ngClass`.
- Learned Directives

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="onTogglebutton()">
  Display Details
</button>
<p *ngIf="displaySecret">Secret Password</p>
<div
  *ngFor="let logItem of log; let i = index"
  [ngStyle]="{ backgroundColor: i >= 5 ? 'red' : 'transparent' }"
  [ngClass]="{ 'white-text': i >= 5 }"
>
  {{ logItem }}
</div>
```

```js
export class AppComponent {
  displaySecret = false;
  log = [];
  onTogglebutton() {
    this.displaySecret = !this.displaySecret;
    this.log.push(new Date());
  }
}
```

```css
.white-text {
  color: white;
}
```
